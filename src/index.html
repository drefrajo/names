            <h1>Hi, mind a little explanation?</h1>
            <p>
                Thank's for checking out this project!
                <br>
                You know the ENS, or DNS? Well, the Names Protocol is very similar, but simplified as much as possible.
                It's main purpose lies in resolving names (say "Bob") to Ethereum addresses (say "0x1234...") and vice versa.
                <br>

            <h1>What for?</h1>
            <p>
                Some time ago I developed the <a href="https://outsider.nugget.network">Outsider Protocol</a>.
                All it does is to check whether some Ethereum address could be a smart contract or not.
                With the Names Protocol I wanted, among other things, to test the practicality of implementing it in another project.
                (My conclusion: it's really easy to do ;])
                Also, I really wanted to develop a blockchain username system.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h1>But ENS already does that!</h1>
            <p>
                You're right.
                <br>
                The thing is, when I looked at ENS, TBH, it seemed kinda complicated.
                It involves 5-day-long process of participating in an auction, to receive the permission to basically "rent" a name.
                These names are resellable, which means some are found on NFT marketplaces while others require the auction process to acquire them.
                Once you control an ENS name, you can add records to it, like, for example, a BTC address.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h1>OK, and you've obviously done it better...?</h1>
            <p>
                IDK. Different.
                <br>
                See, the Names Protocol is really only good for one thing: usernames.
                It does not store any additional data, neither does it feature it's own TLD.
                But - it has its own, more or less unique structure:
                <br>
                A name here is made up of three parts: some arbitrary text, a "/" and a number.
                In practice this results in names like, for example, "Alice/5".
                The thing is, out of the three parts a user only ever gets to directly choose the first.
                <br>
                This is what makes the Names Protocol unique:
                <br>
                <br>
                The number is basically an index for the chosen text.
                <br>
                <br>
                This means that the first to claim "Bob" will be assigned "Bob/0".
                If someone else want's to be "Bob" as well, he is assigned "Bob/1".
                This is important, because through the implementation of Outsider, these names are non-transferable, 
                which in turn means they can never be sold without transferring ones private keys.
                <br>
                In short, this means that once claimed, a name in the Name Protocol will forever resolve the same address.
                Now, if someone decides to change their name, they can do so. 
                When resolving an address to a name, the result will always be the most recent name.
                But any older names remain valid for as long as the blockchain continues to operate.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h1>At what cost?</h1>
            <p>
                Actually, it's really cheap.
                The first name is completely free (+ tx fees).
                <br>
                This results in a slight problem: "Alice/0" is obviously more convenient than, say, "Alice/1553".
                Therefore I've added a slight disincetive: a fee paid with the networks native token.
                Instead of burning it though, I've decided to turn this into a small bounty for myself :O.
                <br>
                In theory this should support further development of such projects.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h1>Help?!</h1>
            <p>
                You're a user? That's great. Use the "Search..." bar to look up either a name or an address - no Ethereum wallet required.
                If you want, you can also claim your own name using the lower part of this dApp.
                <br>
                <br>
                You're a developer? Integrating this into your own software should be pretty easy. See <a href="https://github.com/SirSupersecret/names" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for more details.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Names Protocol is currently only deployed on the Mumbai testnet, but Polygon mainnet will follow soon. 
                As to why not Ethereum:
                In my opinion, Ethereums level of decentralization and security are simply not as important as a frictionless UX (especially for this project).
